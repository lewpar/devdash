# DevDash
Developer Dashboard (DevDash) is designed to be a portal to access developer containers through a touch interface. I originally designed this to run on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an [Elecrow 5" Touch Screen](https://www.elecrow.com/hdmi-5-inch-800x480-tft-display-for-raspberry-pi-b-p-1384.html).

If you want to run this on your Raspberry Pi using the same or similar hardware, you can access the details outlining how to set it up in the `rpi` folder.
